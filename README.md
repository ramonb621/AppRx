# App Rx
This application was designed with the idea of allowing medical professionals the ability to lookup and make notes on medications they deal with as well as allow the same capabilities to patients taking a variety of medications. 

## What does this do?
This application allows you lookup the dosage and administration, side effects, and the contraindications of any medication in the OpenFDA API. You can also save a list of notes about any of the medications to reference at a later time.
